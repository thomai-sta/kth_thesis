This is my master thesis, which was conducted in collaboration between KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

The main research objective is to study and try to predict the progression of subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairement over a number of years and whether or not this condition will develop into Alzheimer's Disease or not, by using longitudinal MRI scans.
